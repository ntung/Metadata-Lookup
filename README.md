# METADATA LOOKUP

This project is born after an endless effort to resolve the name of scientific terms used in bioinformatics projects. By feeding an accession number or perennial identifer of a biological or medical term, the service will look up and return a name or a set of metadata attributes which you can use it for your pipeline.
