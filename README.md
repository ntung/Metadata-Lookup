This project is born after endless efforts to resolve the name of scientific terms used in bioinformatics projects. By feeding an accession number or perennial identifer of a biological or medical term, the service will look up and return a name or a set of metadata attributes which you can use it for your pipeline.

## Using the app as a FastAPI server

Start the server `python main.py` after creating a Python virtual environment.
